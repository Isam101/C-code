C Practice Programs — Learning C from Scratch

This repository documents my journey learning the C programming language from the ground up.
Each file focuses on one concept, written in a simple and beginner-friendly way and progressively increasing in difficulty.

My goal: build a solid foundation in C so I can confidently write real programs, understand memory, and later transition into C++, embedded systems, or low-level engineering projects.

✅ What’s inside

✔ User input and output
✔ If/else logic and boolean conditions
✔ Switch cases
✔ Functions (including multiple functions in one program)
✔ Enums and how to use them
✔ Structs (creating custom data types)
✔ 1D and 2D arrays
✔ Loops (for, while, nested loops)
✔ Pointer basics
✔ Small practical mini-projects

✅ Example Programs I built

✅ Age checker using two functions

✅ Bank Program (basic transaction logic)

✅ Weight converter

✅ Shopping cart calculator

✅ Name storage and validation

✅ New Years countdown

✅ Calculator using switch

✅ Surface area of a sphere

✅ Print strings from array

✅ Print 2D arrays with nested loops

✅ Enum usage examples

✅ Ternary operator practice

✅ First pointer programs

Each program shows improvements in logic, syntax, and structure.

✅ Why I’m doing this

C is one of the most important programming languages in engineering and computer science.
It teaches:

memory management

low-level thinking

how computers actually work

how modern languages like C++, Python, Java are built

This repo shows my progress and will continue growing with harder projects.

✅ Next Steps

File handling (read/write files)

Dynamic memory (malloc, free)

Linked lists

More pointer work

Larger real project (ATM, mini-bank system, or embedded sensor project)
